    <!--as usual there should be a flex container here-->
    <!--then a navbar-->
    <!--the content box should be quite wide though. the text bigger too-->
    <!--and some images with text possibly wrapped around them, but dunno how thatd be possible with flex-->
        <!--regarding that, i actually havent tried floating the image with the text inside another div, have i?-->
        <!--so the flex applies only to the div containing it and not its contents... i might be onto something-->

        <!--scratch all that NEW IDEA: i will use the second picture as a background then as it scrolls it fades to black like a semi parallax effect but not really?-->
        <!--like those fancy news articles mostly-->
        <!--below that will be mostly text, with some more images-->
