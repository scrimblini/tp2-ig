            Daniel Lopatin was born in Massachusetts to a family with a musical background. His first experiences with electronic music were inspired by his father's music collection and his Roland Juno-60 synthesizer, which he went on to extensively use in his own work, even nicknaming it "Judy".
He performed at school events by playing synthesizer, and later on attended Pratt Institute to study archival science, which greatly influenced aspects of his music and artistic practice.

    <!--as usual there should be a flex container here-->
    <!--then a navbar-->
    <!--the content box should be quite wide though. the text bigger too-->
    <!--and some images with text possibly wrapped around them, but dunno how thatd be possible with flex-->
        <!--regarding that, i actually havent tried floating the image with the text inside another div, have i?-->
        <!--so the flex applies only to the div containing it and not its contents... i might be onto something-->

        <!--scratch all that NEW IDEA: i will use the second picture as a background then as it scrolls it fades to black like a semi parallax effect but not really?-->
        <!--like those fancy news articles mostly-->
        <!--below that will be mostly text, with some more images-->


    <!--footer matching color-->
