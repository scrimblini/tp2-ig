# Trabajo Práctico N°2 Informática General

The website will be centered on experimental electronic music artist Oneohtrix Point Never.

due to the nature of the assignment, i should be actually coding this website in Spanish, however i just decided i would default to english because i can think faster on it then i would attempt to translate it in a later stage.

pages up next (in order of relevance):

- ext biography
- albums (WILL include the slideshow gallery)
- film scores
- merch
- newsletter (obligatory data form)
- and an about me page

in total along with the index page, that would be about 7 pages. however, it doesnt meet the minimum required number of pages necessary for this assignment (9 pages/subsections), so i might have to figure something out later.


need to figure out:
- which libraries to use (assess what specific functionality i want the page to have instead of writing it myself)
- how to make libraries work
- how to use the frameworks (i have been mostly writing my own code till now but will use frameworks as a backup option)
- make a proper project research document instead of having all my work scattered all over the place
